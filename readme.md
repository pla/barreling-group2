# Barreling Group 2

Updated <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/barreling-group-ex> for Factorio 2.0

This expands on the original version by leviothan with added support for Intermediate Bulk Containers. Deadlock stacked recipes is also an optional dependency to prevent some unwanted barrel recipes that should not have formed.
